Code review

1. Code structure and naming conventions

-package name is too generic; where is the module name?
- improper class name
- improper function name
- improper function arguments

2. Implementation
- too many "magic number" (hard-coded values)
- is t limited to {1,2,3,4}
- no validations

3. Single Responsability & KISS
