Code review

1. Code structure and naming conventions

- package name is too generic;
- class name is too generic (what kind of account: social network account,bank account, metin2 account...?);
- class attributes are visible outside the class
- class attributes are not defined on separated rows
- inconsistent class attributes names
- inconsistent code indentation
- inconsistent functions names
- inconsistent constructor definition; no default constructor 
- inconsistent constructor placement
 
2. Implementation
- too many hard-coded values
- presence of functions with no use
- presence of unused variables declared inside functions  
- too few validations
- validations throw the same exception; 

3. Single Responsibility & KISS
- Reduce the complexity of the existing functions - KISS
- create interfaces that will handle validations for the creation of a bank account

4. Single Responsibility & Dependency Inversion (DIP)
- refactor custom exceptions framework
- remove the dependency on how we validate the attributes
- remove the dependency on how we compute the interest and the total fees of a list of bank accounts
- handle operation on bank account by other entity
