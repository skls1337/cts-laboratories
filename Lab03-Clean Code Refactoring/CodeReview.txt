Code review

1. Code structure and naming conventions

-package name is too generic; where is the module name?
- improper class name
- improper function name
- improper function arguments

2. Implementation
- too many "magic number" (hard-coded values)
- is t limited to {1,2,3,4}
- no validations

3. Single Responsibility & KISS

4. Reduce the complexity of the existing functions - KISS
-reduce the complexity from the getPriceWithDiscount- repeating pattern
-remove the switch by refactoring the 1st case

5. Single Responsibility & Dependency Inversion (DIP)
-refactor custom exceptions framework
- remove the dependency on how we validate the price and the account age
- remove the dependency on values and operations that are managed by marketing dep.
